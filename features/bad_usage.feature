Feature: Bad usage
    As a lazy coffee user
    I can ignore the message displayed by the machine
    So I can have coffee and let other people have to clean after me

  Scenario: Full grounds doesn't block coffee
    # You keep getting coffee even if the "Empty grounds" message is displayed. That said it's not a fantastic idea, you'll get ground everywhere when you'll decide to empty it.
    Given the coffee machine is started
    And I handle something except the grounds
    When I take "50" coffees
    Then message "Empty grounds" should be displayed
    And coffee should be served
